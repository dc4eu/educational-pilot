# Trusted Lists

## Overview

The system maintains several critical lists to support trust in educational credentials. Within the trust framework, these lists support European education policy through interconnected registries that establish trust across the educational ecosystem.

## Key Components

### Trusted Issuers
- Authorised organisations that can issue credentials
- Ensures only legitimate institutions can grant qualifications
- Maintains academic integrity by authorising legitimate institutions
- Links to national and European educational registries

### Relying Parties
- Organisations authorised to verify and accept credentials
- Creates clear paths for credential recognition
- Supports trustworthy verification processes
- Enables appropriate usage of educational credentials

### Trusted Accreditation Organisations
- Bodies that validate educational institutions
- Maintains quality standards
- Links to European quality frameworks like EQAR
- Provides a foundation for institutional trust

### Data Models Catalogue
- Standardised formats for representing educational credentials
- Enables consistent credential representation
- Supports cross-border interpretation of qualifications
- Facilitates automated processing of educational information

### Trusted Schemes
- Templates ensuring consistent credential structure
- Supports automated processing across systems
- Defines standard formats for different credential types
- Enables semantic interoperability

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing trusted lists:
- Governance processes for list management must be clearly defined
- Update mechanisms must maintain system integrity
- List verification should be efficient and reliable
- Privacy considerations should be addressed in list design
- Cross-border recognition should be supported

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, trusted lists provide:
- Recognition of institutional authority across member states
- Consistent verification of accreditation status
- Support for qualification recognition
- Interoperability between different national systems

## Integration with European Frameworks

Trusted lists integrate with:
- European Quality Assurance Register (EQAR)
- National qualification frameworks
- European Qualification Framework (EQF)
- European Education Area initiatives
- Bologna Process mechanisms
