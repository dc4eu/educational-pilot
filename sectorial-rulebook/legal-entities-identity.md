# Legal Entity's Identity

## Overview

Educational institutions need reliable digital identification through public key infrastructure (PKI) with X.509v3 digital certificates. This system assigns unique digital identifiers to institutions, linking them with public certificates for seamless identity verification across European systems.

## Key Components

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
The PKI provides a trust framework that enables secure digital interactions between educational institutions and other entities in the ecosystem.

### X.509v3 Digital Certificates
These certificates:
- Provide cryptographic proof of institutional identity
- Contain standardised attributes for educational entities
- Support certificate validation and revocation
- Enable digital signing of credentials and documents

## Benefits for Educational Institutions

The digital identity system for legal entities:
- Maintains institutional autonomy while enabling European-wide participation
- Supports institution-specific internal processes
- Enables secure issuance of verifiable credentials
- Facilitates trusted communication between institutions
- Supports cross-border recognition and verification

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing legal entity identification:
- Certificate issuance processes must validate institutional legitimacy
- Certificate attributes should align with European educational registries
- Key management practices must follow security best practices
- Certificate renewal and revocation processes must be clearly defined
- Technical integration should support existing institutional systems

## Integration with Trust Frameworks

Legal entity identities integrate with broader trust frameworks through:
- Links to institutional accreditation information
- Connection to trusted issuer registries
- Alignment with European quality assurance systems
- Support for multi-level institutional structures (departments, faculties)
- Interoperability with European educational registries

## Cross-Border Considerations

For cross-border educational interactions, the system provides:
- Recognition of institutional authority across member states
- Verification of institutional credentials in multiple languages
- Support for institutional mobility and cooperation
- Consistent verification of institutional authority
