# Sharing Mechanisms

## Overview

The credential sharing framework supports European mobility through standardised protocols that enable secure and privacy-preserving exchange of educational and professional qualifications. These mechanisms balance security, privacy, and interoperability needs.

## Key Support Areas

The credential sharing framework supports:
- Cross-border credential recognition
- Privacy-protected verification
- Quality assurance validation
- Institutional trust verification

## Technical Implementation

The credential sharing system uses OpenID for Verifiable Presentations to:

### Establish Secure Connections
- Create secure channels between wallets and verifiers
- Encrypt communication
- Validate authenticity of all parties
- Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

### Verify Proof of Possession
- Confirm the presenter controls the wallet
- Validate wallet authenticity
- Link credentials to presenter
- Prevent credential misuse

### Check Relying Party Trustworthiness
- Verify the authority of requesting parties
- Validate their presence on trusted lists
- Ensure appropriate data handling policies
- Prevent unauthorised access

### Validate Information Proportionality
- Check that requested data is necessary
- Enforce data minimisation principles
- Prevent excessive data collection
- Support user privacy

### Enable Credential Combination
- Allow multiple credentials to be presented together
- Support composite verification
- Combine credentials from different issuers
- Create comprehensive qualification profiles

### Support Selective Disclosure Policies
- Enable sharing of specific attributes only
- Implement cryptographic selective disclosure
- Prevent unnecessary data exposure
- Put users in control of their data

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing sharing mechanisms:
- Security measures should protect credential integrity
- Privacy considerations should guide data transmission
- Performance should support efficient verification
- User experience should be intuitive and transparent
- Interoperability with various systems should be maintained

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, sharing mechanisms provide:
- Consistent protocols across member states
- Support for multilingual credential sharing
- Interoperability with different verification systems
- Recognition of credentials across institutions

## User Control

The sharing framework emphasises user control through:
- Explicit consent mechanisms
- Clear presentation of sharing requests
- Transparent explanation of data usage
- Options for selective disclosure
- Ability to cancel sharing processes
