# Enforcement Policy Agent

## Overview

The wallet's policy enforcement role implements European privacy principles in practical ways, putting students in control of their educational records while protecting against excessive data collection. This approach transforms privacy principles into technical safeguards.

## Key Privacy Principles Implementation

### User Control
- Students control their educational records
- Users make informed sharing decisions
- Individuals maintain authority over personal data
- Educational history remains under personal management

### Data Minimisation
- Institutions request only necessary data
- Systems prevent excessive data collection
- Proportionality is technically enforced
- Context-specific data sharing is supported

### Automated Privacy Protection
- Privacy protection becomes automatic
- Technical safeguards complement legal protections
- User rights are implemented in code
- Privacy by design becomes operational

### Cross-Border Rights Protection
- Cross-border rights remain protected
- Consistent privacy enforcement across jurisdictions
- European values maintained across borders
- Uniform protection regardless of location

## Digital Wallet Enforcement Mechanisms

Digital wallets act as policy enforcers by:

### Detection of Disproportionate Requests
- Analysing data requests against purpose
- Flagging excessive information requirements
- Comparing requests to standard patterns
- Identifying unusual data collection attempts

### User Warnings
- Warning users about excessive data sharing
- Providing clear information about unusual requests
- Explaining potential privacy implications
- Offering guidance on privacy-preserving alternatives

### Access Control
- Blocking unauthorised information access when appropriate
- Implementing granular permission systems
- Enforcing purpose limitations
- Preventing unintended data exposure

### User Privacy Management
- Maintaining user control over personal data
- Providing comprehensive privacy dashboards
- Enabling preference management
- Supporting informed decision-making

## Implementation Notes

To fully respect individuals' rights, "Blocking" won't be applied at the sectorial level, meaning:
- Users retain final decision-making authority
- Wallets provide warnings but respect user choices
- Education sector emphasises informed consent
- Technical controls are balanced with user autonomy

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing enforcement policy agents:
- User interfaces should clearly communicate privacy implications
- Default settings should prioritise privacy
- Technical performance should not be compromised
- User education should complement technical controls
- Balance should be maintained between protection and usability

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, enforcement policy agents provide:
- Consistent privacy protection across member states
- Support for varied educational contexts
- Maintenance of European privacy values
- User control in international settings
