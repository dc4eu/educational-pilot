# Overview

## Purpose of the Rulebook

This Rulebook defines the framework for the issuance, authorisation, verification, and cross-border recognition of digital credentials in the domains of education and professional qualifications, using **Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs)**.

It provides the governance, technical, and operational foundation for how trust is established in **who is allowed to issue** a credential â€” and how that authorisation can be verified across jurisdictions.

---

## Relation to the EAA Framework

The Rulebook operates within the **European Digital Identity (EUDI)** ecosystem and implements core components of the **eIDAS 2.0 Regulation**, enabling digital credential ecosystems to be:

- **Interoperable** across borders  
- **Legally valid** across domains  
- **Technically verifiable** using open standards

This includes integration with:
- The **European Education Area (EEA)**
- The **European Qualifications Framework (EQF)**
- **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)**
- **Trust Services**, including PKI and decentralised trust registries
- **European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)**

---

## Scope of the Model

This Rulebook **does not define the credentials issued to end users** (e.g. diplomas, licences). Instead, it governs the trust model that enables:

- Authorisation of credential issuers (e.g. universities, professional bodies)
- Verifiable chains of trust up to recognised authorities (e.g. ministries)
- Discovery and validation of authorisations by relying parties (e.g. employers, institutions)

---

## Alignment with DC4EU Deliverables

This Rulebook complements and builds upon:

- The **Sectoral EAA Catalogue** (semantic and credential definitions)
- The **DC4EU Business Blueprint** (Deliverable 5.1)
- Future **Implementation Toolkits** (for technical onboarding)

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Who Is This For?

This Rulebook is intended for:
- Ministries and public authorities in charge of education and professional regulation
- Higher education institutions and VET providers
- Professional associations and QA agencies
- Trust service providers (qualified or non-qualified)
- Developers of EUDI Wallets and verification systems

---

## Objectives

- Define an interoperable and decentralised authorisation model  
- Ensure trusted, verifiable delegation of authority to credential issuers  
- Align with European legal and policy frameworks  
- Enable scalable onboarding of actors across Member States
