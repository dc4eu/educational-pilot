# Selective Disclosure with BBS+ Signatures

## Introduction
BBS+ Signatures provide an advanced cryptographic approach to **selective disclosure**, enabling users to reveal only the necessary attributes from a Verifiable Credential (**VC**). This ensures **privacy, data minimization, and compliance with GDPR and eIDAS 2.0**, making it ideal for digital identity verification, education, and professional qualifications.

BBS+ Signatures offer **privacy-enhanced verifiable credentials**, making them ideal for **education, employment, and digital identity ecosystems**. Their **selective disclosure capabilities** provide a secure and scalable solution for **EUDI Wallets, eIDAS, and decentralized identity frameworks**.

## Business Perspective
### Why BBS+ Signatures Matter
- **Privacy-first**: Users disclose only the required data fields.
- **GDPR & eIDAS Compliance**: Supports selective attribute disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Security**: Cryptographically verifiable credentials reduce fraud and unauthorized access.
- **Interoperability**: Aligns with **Verifiable Credentials (W3C-VC)** and **EUDI Wallet** for digital identity.

### Use Cases
- **Higher Education**: Universities issue digital diplomas with attribute-level disclosure.
- **Employment Verification**: Job applicants share only their degree, omitting unnecessary data.
- **Healthcare & Financial Services**: Users prove eligibility while keeping sensitive information private.

## Technical Perspective
### How BBS+ Signatures Work
BBS+ enables **multi-message signing** and **zero-knowledge proofs**, allowing users to prove the authenticity of individual credential attributes without exposing the entire credential.

1. **Issuer signs a Verifiable Credential (VC) with BBS+**.
2. **Holder derives a proof** using selected attributes.
3. **Verifier validates the proof** without accessing unnecessary information.

### BBS+ Signed Verifiable Credential Structure
```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"],
  "id": "cde7eeb3-2e9a-4d4d-91ff-bc3a2a8d93c5",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "StudentID"],
  "issuer": "did:ebsi:zvHWX359A3CvfJnCYaAiAde",
  "validFrom": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:key:z2dmz...",
    "familyName": "Carroll",
    "givenName": "Lewis",
    "birthDate": "1832-01-27",
    "student": true
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "BbsBlsSignature2020",
    "created": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:ebsi:zvHWX359A3CvfJnCYaAiAde#keys-1",
    "proofValue": "z5mvD..."
  }
}
```

## Issuance & Presentation Lifecycle
### Issuance Flow
1. **Issuer creates a Verifiable Credential (VC)** in JSON-LD.
2. **Signs the entire credential** using BBS+.
3. **Sends the credential to the holder**.

### Presentation Flow
1. **Holder selects specific attributes** to reveal.
2. **Derives a BBS+ proof** from the original signature.
3. **Verifier validates the proof** without requiring the full credential.

### Example BBS+ Derived Proof Format
```plaintext
<BBS+ Signature Proof>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>
```

## Code Example: Verifying a BBS+ Proof
```python
from pyld import jsonld
from bbs import BBSPlus

# Load VC and extract proof
vc = jsonld.compact(vc_data, vc_context)
proof = vc["proof"]

# Verify proof
verified = BBSPlus.verify_proof(proof, disclosed_attributes)
print("Verification successful:", verified)
```

## Deployment on GitHub Pages
1. **Create a GitHub repository** named `bbs-plus-guide`.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** via repository settings.
3. **Commit this `index.md` file** to the `main` branch.
4. **GitHub will generate a webpage** at `https://yourusername.github.io/bbs-plus-guide/`.
