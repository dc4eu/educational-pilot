# The Learning Belongs to the Learner

## A Learner-Centred Vision

In a digitally empowered Europe, individuals should be able to own and control their educational and professional credentials — securely, privately, and across borders.

This section presents the guiding vision behind the DC4EU authorisation model: a **learner-centric ecosystem** where digital trust enables mobility, transparency, and personal agency.

## Real-life Scenario

María is a 24-year-old student at Rovira i Virgili University (URV) in Spain. After completing her degree, she receives a **digitally verifiable diploma** directly into her **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet)**.

The diploma includes a **Verifiable Credential** attested by URV, who is authorised by the Ministry of Universities under the DC4EU trust framework. The authorisation itself is also digitally signed and traceable via an Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA).

## European Mobility in Action

María decides to apply for a Master’s programme in France.

Using her EUDI Wallet, she shares:
- Her degree credential
- The authorisation credential proving URV is entitled to issue such degrees

The French university can instantly verify both credentials:
- The **degree** is cryptographically authentic
- The **issuer’s authority** is valid, recognised, and still in force

María is accepted — without the need for paper documents, translations, or institutional emails.

## Privacy and Control

At all times, María controls:
- **What she shares**
- **With whom**
- **For what purpose**

She can:
- Selectively disclose information (e.g. just her EQF level)
- Revoke access
- Present credentials even offline

## Empowerment Through Trust

This scenario is not fiction — it is the vision enabled by the DC4EU authorisation model and aligned with:
- eIDAS 2.0
- The European Education Area (EEA)
- The European Digital Identity (EUDI) framework

By embedding trust into credentials and authorisations, Europe empowers its learners to carry their achievements with them — securely, transparently, and in full control.

## Key Takeaway

> **"The learning belongs to the learner."**

DC4EU transforms this principle into practice, making digital recognition of education and professional qualifications real and reliable for every citizen in the EU.
