# Implementation in DC4EU

This section describes how the EAA-based authorisation model is being implemented in the **DC4EU Large Scale Pilot** for the domains of education and professional qualifications.

The model is already applied in real-world scenarios across Member States, demonstrating its cross-border potential and adaptability to various governance structures.
