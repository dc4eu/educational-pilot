# Education and Professional Qualifications Sectorial Rulebook

## Overview

The education and professional qualifications sectorial rulebook establishes a standardised approach for managing digital educational and professional credentials within the European Union. This framework balances member state sovereignty with European integration needs, creating a unified system that supports educational mobility while respecting national and institutional autonomy.

- **[Natural Person's Identity](./natural-persons-identity.md)**: How the European Digital Identity wallet serves as a harmonised electronic identification method.

- **[Legal Entity's Identity](./legal-entities-identity.md)**: How educational institutions establish reliable digital identification through public key infrastructure.

- **[Identity Matching](./identity-matching.md)**: How personal identification data and member state-specific matching rules create a unified approach to identity verification.

The technical implementations always support policy priorities, making the system both practically useful and politically aligned with European goals for education, privacy, and mobility.
