- Distributes trust and responsibility
- Supports system resilience
- Maintains institutional autonomy

### Pan-European Coverage
- Functions across all member states
- Supports cross-border operations
- Enables European-wide recognition
- Maintains consistency across regions

### Privacy-enhanced Verification
- Protects user privacy during verification
- Prevents unnecessary tracking
- Implements data minimisation
- Supports selective disclosure

### Data Protection Compliance
- Aligns with GDPR requirements
- Implements privacy by design
- Supports data subject rights
- Enables appropriate governance

### Security Audit Mechanisms
- Provides transparency on system operation
- Enables security verification

### Verification Record Keeping
- Maintains appropriate audit trails
- Supports future verification needs
- Enables dispute resolution
- Provides operational evidence

### Service Discovery Tools
- Helps locate verification services
- Supports issuer discovery
- Enables wallet-service connections
- Facilitates ecosystem navigation

### Cross-country Legal Entity Recognition
- Supports recognition of institutions across borders
- Enables trust in foreign entities
- Maintains consistent verification
- Supports institutional mobility

## Implementation Considerations
