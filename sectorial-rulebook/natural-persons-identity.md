# Natural Person's Identity

## Overview

The European Digital Identity wallet serves as a harmonised electronic identification method, introducing personal identification data (PID) as the preferred option when high security is needed. This system respects member state authority over identity while creating a consistent European approach.

## Key Components

### Personal Identification Data (PID)
The PID provides a standardised set of identity attributes that can be reliably verified across member states while respecting national sovereignty in identity management.

### European Digital Identity Wallet
The wallet provides a secure container for identity credentials that can be used across the European educational ecosystem.

## Implementation in Educational Contexts

This approach streamlines identity verification in educational contexts, particularly in two main processes:

### Registration and Enrolment
When students begin their educational journey, secure identification is required to:
- Create educational accounts
- Verify eligibility for programmes
- Establish student records
- Link to national educational systems

### Formal Degree Issuance
When official qualifications are awarded, reliable identity confirmation is needed to:
- Ensure credentials are issued to the correct individual
- Create tamper-proof links between credentials and identity
- Support cross-border verification of qualifications
- Maintain the integrity of educational systems

## Integration with Existing Systems

Integration with existing educational identity systems requires:
- Mapping between institutional identifiers and European Digital Identity
- Privacy-preserving linking protocols
- Consent management for data sharing
- Clear audit trails for identity verification events

## Cross-Border Considerations

For cross-border educational mobility, the system provides:
- Recognition of identification across member states
- Consistent identity verification processes
- Maintenance of identity sovereignty
- Support for multilingual identity attributes
