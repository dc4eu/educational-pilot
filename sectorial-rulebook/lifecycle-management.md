# Lifecycle Management

## Overview

The credential lifecycle system supports educational mobility while protecting credential integrity. This balance enables institutions to manage qualifications independently while ensuring European-wide recognition. The system incorporates privacy-by-design principles, letting institutions update credential status without tracking usage patterns.

## Key Components

### Credential Status Tracking
- Tracks credential status changes (active, suspended, revoked)
- Supports institutional control over credential validity
- Provides transparency about qualification status
- Maintains credential integrity

### Privacy-Preserving Verification
- Maintains verification services that respect privacy
- Prevents tracking of credential usage
- Protects student privacy rights
- Implements data minimisation principles

### Institutional Management Tools
- Provides tools for educational institutions to manage their issued credentials
- Enables administrative processes for credential updates
- Supports institutional autonomy
- Facilitates credential maintenance

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing lifecycle management:
- Status update mechanisms must be secure and authenticated
- Privacy protection should be built into all verification processes
- Status information should be available without compromising privacy
- Audit trails should document status changes
- Revocation should be effective across the ecosystem

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, lifecycle management provides:
- Consistent status verification across member states
- Support for qualification recognition throughout credential lifecycle
- Privacy protection for mobile students
- Maintenance of credential integrity across borders

## Lifecycle Status Types

The system supports various status types:
- **Active**: The credential is valid and can be trusted
- **Suspended**: The credential is temporarily invalidated
- **Revoked**: The credential has been permanently invalidated
- **Expired**: The credential is no longer valid due to time limitations
- **Updated**: The credential has been replaced by a newer version

## Privacy-by-Design Principles

The system implements privacy-by-design through:
- Privacy-preserving status checking
- Data minimisation in status responses
- Unlinkability of verification requests
- User control over credential usage
- Transparency about status information
