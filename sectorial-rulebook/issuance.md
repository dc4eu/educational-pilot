# Issuance

## Overview

The issuance process establishes how educational and professional credentials are created and delivered to users. Different types of attestations follow specific issuance pathways depending on their legal status and the issuing entity.

## Attestation Types

### Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA)
- Provided by qualified trust service providers
- Requires citizen consent
- Needs data validation through member state mechanisms
- Has the highest level of legal recognition
- Follows stringent validation requirements

### Public Sector Body Electronic Attestation of Attributes (PSBEAA)
- Issued by public sector bodies
- Must meet specific regulatory requirements
- Public sector bodies act as both authentic source and issuer
- Has strong legal recognition
- Follows public sector governance rules

### Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA)
- General category for digital credentials
- Can be issued by various entities
- Follows standardised issuance processes
- Supports educational and professional use cases
- Enables interoperability across systems

## Issuance Process

The EAA issuance process follows these steps:

1. **Secure Connection Establishment**
   - Create a secure channel with the European Digital Identity Wallet
   - Ensure encrypted communication
   - Validate wallet authenticity

2. **Identity Verification**
   - Verify the identity of the credential recipient when required
   - Use appropriate level of assurance
   - Follow privacy-by-design principles

3. **Identity Matching**
   - Match the verified identity with institutional records
   - Apply member state-specific matching rules
   - Ensure accurate attribution of credentials

4. **Data Gathering**
   - Collect relevant data from authentic sources
   - Validate data accuracy and completeness
   - Ensure data provenance

5. **Credential Creation**
   - Structure data according to trusted schemas
   - Create verifiable credential format
   - Apply appropriate cryptographic proofs

6. **Quality Assurance Information**
   - Add accreditation details
   - Include quality framework references
   - Link to relevant standards

7. **Digital Identifier Selection**
   - Choose appropriate identifiers for credential elements
   - Ensure unique identification
   - Support future verification

8. **Delivery to Wallet**
   - Direct issuance: immediately deliver to wallet
   - Deferred issuance: provide access mechanisms
   - Ensure secure transmission

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing issuance processes:
- Security measures should protect against unauthorised issuance
- Privacy considerations should guide data collection
- Consent mechanisms should be clearly implemented
- Audit trails should document issuance activities
- Revocation mechanisms should be established

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, issuance provides:
- Consistent credential formats across member states
- Support for multilingual credential content
- Interoperability with different wallet implementations
- Recognition of credentials across institutions
