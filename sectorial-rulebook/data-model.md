# Data Model

## Overview

The credential data model follows W3C Verifiable Credential standards, structuring educational data in a consistent format. This standardised approach enables interoperability while supporting the specific needs of educational credentials.

## Key Components

Each credential includes:

### Context Definitions
- Provides semantic definitions for credential interpretation
- Enables consistent understanding across systems
- Links to standardised vocabularies
- Supports semantic interoperability

### Unique Identifier
- Creates a distinct reference for each credential
- Supports verification and tracking
- Enables reference across systems
- Maintains credential distinctiveness

### Credential Type
- Indicates the nature of the educational achievement
- Supports appropriate handling by different systems
- Enables filtering and categorisation
- Aligns with educational taxonomies

### Issuing Authority Identifier
- Links the credential to its authoritative source
- Supports trust verification
- Enables institutional recognition
- Connects to trusted issuer registries

### Issue Date
- Records when the credential was officially granted
- Supports timelines of achievement
- Enables chronological organisation
- Facilitates validity checking

### Credential Holder Information
- Identifies the person to whom the credential belongs
- Links achievements to individual educational journeys
- Supports privacy-protecting identification
- Enables appropriate credential attribution

### Cryptographic Proof of Authenticity
- Ensures the credential hasn't been tampered with
- Supports verification of issuer authority
- Enables trust establishment
- Protects credential integrity

### Multi-language Support
- Enables credential interpretation across languages
- Supports mobility across language regions
- Facilitates cross-border understanding
- Respects linguistic diversity

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the data model:
- JSON-LD contexts should be properly maintained
- Cryptographic suites should follow current best practices
- Schema validation should be implemented
- Extensibility should be supported for future needs
- Backwards compatibility should be maintained

## Cross-Border Scenarios

For cross-border educational mobility, the data model provides:
- Consistent interpretation of credentials across member states
- Support for multilingual credential representation
- Standardised formats for qualification recognition
- Interoperability between different national systems

## Alignment with Standards

The data model aligns with:
- W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model
- European Learning Model
- Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure
- Schema.org educational vocabulary
- European Qualifications Framework
