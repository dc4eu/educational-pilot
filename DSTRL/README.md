# DC4EU Deployment and Testing Scenarios Results Library (DTSRL)

## Overview

The **Deployment and Testing Scenarios Results Library (DTSRL)** is a comprehensive repository that documents real-world implementation scenarios for digital credentials in the European educational and professional qualifications ecosystem. As part of the **DC4EU (Digital Credentials for Europe)** Large Scale Pilot under the eIDAS 2.0 framework, the DTSRL serves as the central knowledge base for piloting agents implementing verifiable digital credentials across European institutions.

## What is the DTSRL?

The DTSRL is a structured collection of **validated deployment scenarios** that demonstrates how educational and professional institutions across Europe successfully implement digital credential systems using both **Classical PKI** and **Decentralised PKI** trust models. It provides practical guidance, tested user journeys, and proven implementation patterns for widespread adoption of the **EUDI Wallet ecosystem**.

### Key Characteristics

- **Operational Unit**: Each scenario serves as the complete implementation framework for piloting agents
- **Cross-Border Focus**: Scenarios designed for interoperability across EU Member States
- **Multi-Pilot Architecture**: Supports both Pilot 1 (Classical PKI + SD-JWT-VC) and Pilot 2 (Combined Classical PKI + Decentralised PKI - dPKI using EBSI + W3C VC + W3C-VCDM )
- **Compliance Framework**: Aligned with eIDAS 2.0 regulation and EBSI standards
- **Real-World Validation**: Based on actual implementations by participating institutions

## Core Components

### **Scenario Definitions**
Complete structured definitions provided by piloting agents, including:
- Target user journeys (students, professionals, administrative staff)
- Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs) specifications
- Technical component configurations (issuer, verifier, wallet services)
- Governance setup (DIDs, authorisations, trust registrations)
- Monitoring and KPI frameworks

### **User Journey Documentation**
Detailed step-by-step processes covering:
- **DC4EU-001**: Person Identification Data (PID) retrieval
- **DC4EU-002**: Verifiable Educational/Professional ID issuance
- **DC4EU-003**: Education/Professional achievement credentials
- **DC4EU-004**: Cross-border EAA verification

### **Technical Implementation Guides**
Architecture-specific toolkits and components:

#### Pilot 1 (Classical PKI + SD-JWT)
- Traditional Certificate Authority trust chains
- SD-JWT credential format
- Established PKI infrastructure compatibility

#### Pilot 2 (Decentralised PKI + W3C VC)
- EBSI blockchain-based trust
- W3C Verifiable Credentials standard
- Combined classical and decentralised trust models

### **Cross-Border Verification Services**
Public DNS endpoints for credential verification across participating countries:
- **20+ institutions** across Europe
- **Real-time verification endpoints**
- **Multi-language support**
- **Compliance validation**
