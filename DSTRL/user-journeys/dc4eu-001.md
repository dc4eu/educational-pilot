### **User Journey for a Person Identification Data (PID) retreival**

#### **1. Awareness & Need Recognition**  
- The student realizes they need a PID to obtain a verifiable credential.  
- They learn about the PID process through the university or digital identity guidelines.  
- They explore requirements for obtaining a PID.  
- They confirm their eligibility based on university or national identity criteria.  

#### **2. Pre-Authentication & Authorization**  
- The student accesses the university's PID issuance portal.  
- They request to initiate the PID issuance process.  
- The system redirects them to the identity provider for authentication.  
- The student logs in with their credentials (e.g., university ID, government ID).  
- The identity provider verifies the student’s authentication.  

#### **3. Initiating Credential Offer**  
- The PID system generates a credential offer request.  
- The system prepares a QR code for secure credential retrieval.  
- The student scans the QR code using their mobile wallet.  
- They input a user PIN to confirm their request.  
- The mobile wallet redirects to the issuer for further processing.  

#### **4. Token Request & Authentication**  
- The mobile wallet requests an authentication token from the issuer.  
- The issuer validates the request and provides an access token.  
- The student’s mobile wallet uses this token to proceed with the credential request.  
- The issuer queries the authoritative source (e.g., university database) for student information.  
- The authoritative source returns verified educational details.  

#### **5. Credential Issuance & Receipt**  
- The issuer generates a verifiable credential with the PID.  
- The system sends an event notification confirming credential issuance.  
- The student receives the verifiable credential in their mobile wallet.  
- They check and verify the details of their PID.  
- The PID is now ready for use in obtaining other digital credentials.  

#### **6. Post-Issuance & Usage**  
- The student can now use their PID for university-related verifications.  
- They securely share their PID when applying for other credentials.  
- They receive periodic updates or renewal notifications for PID validity.  

#### **7. Advocacy & Support**  
- The student shares their experience with peers who need a PID.  
- They provide feedback on the PID issuance process (UX, proper process understanding, etc.).  
- They access support in case of technical issues or lost credentials.  
- They advocate for digital identity adoption within the academic community.
