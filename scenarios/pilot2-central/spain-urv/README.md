# Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV)

## Scenario Description

The Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) scenario outlines digital credential implementation for onboarding students in education, issuing educational achievements, and generic verification of educational attestations. URV will pilot this approach with an initial group of 20 final-year undergraduate students, using tools and services from Pilot 2 provided by IZERTIS and ATOS within the DC4EU framework.

## Key Steps per User Journey

### 1. Onboarding in Education
- Select 20 final-year undergraduate students.
- Conduct basic training covering eIDAS2, PID, EAAs, DC4EU framework, and EUDIW significance.
- Provide each student with an EUDIW wallet (IZERTIS).
- Individually verify student identities, issuing access credentials for PID retrieval.
- Guide students through PID retrieval and ensure their wallets are operational.
- Students execute the "EducationalID request" process, validated through PID presentation.
- Upon successful verification, EducationalID is issued, confirming students' affiliation with URV.

### 2. Educational Achievement Issuance
- Students with completed onboarding request issuance of academic achievements.
- Using their EducationalID within the EUDIW wallet, students securely access the academic achievement request platform.
- Identity matching with URV's authentic source databases presents a list of achievements eligible for issuance.
- Students select and confirm achievements to be issued as Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs).
- Achievements are issued upon student acceptance and securely stored in their EUDIW wallets.

### 3. Generic EAA Verification
- Provide a publicly accessible verification service for educational EAAs held by citizens.
- Users present an educational EAA via the EUDIW wallet, selecting from the sectoral catalogue.
- Verify the EAA's integrity and governance compliance, including issuer validity and appropriate authorisations from educational governance authorities.
- Successful verification confirms the EAA's validity and authenticity.
