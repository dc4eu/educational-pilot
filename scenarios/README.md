# Definition of Scenario

In the context of **DC4EU**, a **scenario** refers to the complete and structured definition provided by a **piloting agent** to characterise and execute one or more **user journeys**. It encompasses the set of technical, organisational, and governance elements required to ensure that the digital credential workflows are functional, compliant, and aligned with the project's architecture.

Each scenario must define:

- The final **user journeys** to be implemented, including target user groups (students, professionals, administrative staff)  
- The specific **Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs)** to be issued and/or verified  
- The institutional systems or databases connected to the **issuance** and **verification** processes  
- The toolkits and technical components used (e.g. **issuer**, **verifier**, **wallet**, **PID retrieval** services)  
- The governance configuration: **identifiers**, **authorisations**, and **trust model registration**  
- The monitoring and reporting structure, including **feedback channels** and **KPIs**

Scenarios serve as the **operational unit** for execution, onboarding, monitoring, and reporting. They provide the **Single Point of Contact (SPOC)** with a clear framework to assess readiness and track the progress of piloting agents throughout the **five implementation phases** defined in the DC4EU methodology.

While the methodology defines common building blocks, each scenario will reflect the **local specificities** of the piloting agent, including language, legal context, and user typologies.

> **Note:** Each piloting agent may define one or multiple scenarios, depending on the diversity of credentials, use cases, or user groups involved.

## Scenario checklist template (optional structure)

To support documentation and review of each scenario, piloting agents are encouraged to complete a structured overview using the template below:
