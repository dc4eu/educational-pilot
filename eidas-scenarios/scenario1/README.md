# Scenario 1: **The non-LSP scenario** - closed ecosystems based on bilateral agreements

This scenario describes electronic attestations of attributes (EAAs) issued in a closed system, meaning the issuers operate under contractual or administrative law frameworks, outside the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) trust model.

## Key characteristics

- **Trust model**: Agreed by ecosystem, as the issuers operate independently of EUDIW.
- **Legal scope**: These EAAs do not need to comply with eIDAS regulatory obligations but may still benefit from the non-discrimination principle (Article 45b(1)), ensuring their legal admissibility in proceedings.
- **Limitations**: Closed systems lack interoperability and do not provide cross-border recognition under eIDAS.
- **Role of EBSI**: In this scenario, EBSI's added value is limited as there is no formal link to the broader EU ecosystem.


## Educational and professional qualifications applications

In the educational context, this scenario might apply to internal university systems or proprietary corporate training platforms that issue credentials only within their closed ecosystem. These credentials lack portability and cross-border recognition from an eIDAS perspective but may still serve specific institutional purposes.
