# Scenario 3: EAAs issued by public sector bodies responsible for an authentic source (Pub_EAAs)

In this scenario, public sector bodies or their authorised entities issue electronic attestations of attributes that must meet strict trust and security requirements equivalent to qualified trust services.

## Key characteristics

- **Trust model**: Follows a regulated and structured PKI model, where issuers must comply with EUDIW protocols (ISO/IEC 18013-5, W3C VC Data Model).
- **Legal scope**: Pub_EAAs have the same legal effect as their paper-based equivalents and benefit from cross-border recognition (Article 45b(3)).
- **Role of EBSI**: Enhances automated trust processing through on-chain verification and cross-border attestation discovery, reinforcing authentic source verification.

## Educational applications

This scenario applies to:
- Public universities and educational institutions
- National education ministries
- Public accreditation bodies
- Governmental qualification authorities
- Public research institutions

These entities can issue credentials that hold the same legal weight as their traditional paper equivalents while gaining the advantages of digital verification and automated trust processing through EBSI integration.
