# Scenario 2: EAAs issued by non-qualified trust service providers (TSPs)

This scenario focuses on EAAs issued by entities that are not qualified under eIDAS but still operate as trust service providers (TSPs). These issuers can register as Wallet Relying Parties in the EUDIW ecosystem and issue attestations under an unregulated but recognised trust model.

## Trust Model Combination: Overcoming classical PKI limitations with EBSI

### Classical PKI limitations

- No predefined supervision or validation process for TSPs.
- No automatic mechanism for verifying the authenticity or trustworthiness of the issuer.
- Relying parties cannot distinguish between issuers that are official sources and those that are simply marketing existing data.
- Lack of cross-border legal recognition unless governed by contract or specific regulations (e.g., Professional Qualifications Directive).

### EBSI's added value

- Enables decentralised identity verification via DID methods to prove issuer authenticity.
- Improves trust automation by allowing relying parties to check on-chain credentials issued by trusted sources.
- Introduces Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to improve privacy and selective disclosure.
- Provides a decentralised registry of TSPs, ensuring that issuers are discoverable, transparent, and accountable.

## Educational applications

This scenario is particularly relevant for:
- Public and private educational institutions issuing non-regulated certifications
- Professional development providers offering industry-recognised credentials
- MOOC platforms and online learning providers
- Educational technology companies offering skill assessments
- Non-governmental organisations providing learning opportunities

By implementing EBSI in this scenario, these organisations can enhance the credibility and verifiability of their credentials without needing to achieve qualified status under eIDAS.
