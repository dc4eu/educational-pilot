# Scenario 4: EAAs issued by qualified trust service providers (QEAAs)

This scenario involves qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) that meet the highest level of trust under eIDAS. These entities issue qualified EAAs (QEAAs), ensuring full compliance with EUDIW protocols, interoperability, and legal recognition across EU Member States.

## Key characteristics

- **Trust model**: Classical strict PKI model, relying on qualified electronic signatures/seals and trusted lists maintained by national supervisory bodies.
- **Legal scope**: QEAAs benefit from legal equivalence and automatic cross-border recognition (Article 24a(9)).
- **Role of EBSI**: Enhances automation and verifiability by:
  - Recording qualified issuers in an immutable, decentralised ledger.
  - Providing immediate discoverability for verifiers and relying parties.
  - Supporting smart contracts for automated validation of EAAs.

## Educational applications

This scenario represents the highest level of trust for educational credentials and applies to:
- National qualification authorities requiring legal certainty
- Regulated professional qualifications with legal effects
- Professional licensing bodies with statutory authority
- Cross-border educational credentials requiring automatic recognition
- Credentials with significant legal or professional consequences

QEAAs in the educational context benefit from the combined strength of qualified trust services and EBSI's enhanced automation and verification capabilities.
