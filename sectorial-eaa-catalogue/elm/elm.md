# European learning model (ELM)

## What is ELM?

The **European learning model (ELM)** is a structured, standardised data model designed to clearly describe educational achievements and credentials.

It covers formal education, non-formal learning, and informal learning experiences, providing a common language across Europe to ensure transparency, interoperability, and recognition of skills and qualifications.

## Purpose of ELM

ELM allows educational institutions, employers, learners, and credential-verifying bodies to communicate clearly and effectively about learning achievements and credentials.

Key benefits include:

- **Interoperability** across European systems.
- Easier recognition of qualifications.
- Clear communication of learning outcomes.
- Standardised descriptions for credentials.

## Main components of ELM

### Learning achievements  
Clearly defined skills, competences, or knowledge acquired through education or training.

### Qualifications  
Official certifications awarded upon successful completion of educational or training programmes.

### Accreditation  
Formal recognition that an educational programme meets defined quality standards.

### Assessment  
Methods and criteria used to evaluate learners' knowledge and skills.

### Learning activities  
Structured activities designed to facilitate knowledge and skill acquisition.

### Learning outcomes  
Detailed statements describing the skills, knowledge, and competences learners should achieve after completing a learning activity or programme.

### Verification  
Mechanisms ensuring authenticity, reliability, and validity of credentials.

## Types of learning covered by ELM

- **Formal learning**: Structured education programmes typically leading to officially recognised qualifications (e.g., university degrees, vocational training).

- **Non-formal learning**: Structured educational activities not necessarily leading to official qualifications (e.g., professional training courses, seminars).

- **Informal learning**: Unstructured learning occurring through daily activities, work experience, volunteering, or self-directed study.

## Technical aspects (for technical users)

### Data model structure  
ELM uses an ontology-based model clearly defining classes, properties, and relationships. It comprehensively describes educational credentials, assessments, accreditations, and associated metadata.

### Relation to European digital credentials (EDC)  
- **ELM** provides the conceptual foundation.
- **EDC** applies ELM specifically for digital credential implementations, adding technical constraints and validations (e.g., SHACL, JSON-LD contexts).

### Standards and interoperability  
ELM aligns closely with existing educational data standards and European frameworks. It is inspired by—but not identical to—W3C verifiable credentials, aiming for broad interoperability.

## Practical use cases of ELM

- **Higher education institutions** describe qualifications, diploma supplements, and credentials clearly.
- **Vocational training providers** detail skills and professional certifications transparently.
- **Employers and recruiters** interpret and verify candidate credentials reliably and efficiently.
- **Learners** present clear, verifiable records of skills and achievements.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Is ELM a technical standard?**  
ELM is primarily a conceptual ontology. Technical implementations like EDC build on top of ELM.

**Is ELM mandatory for European institutions?**  
ELM is not mandatory but is highly recommended by EU frameworks like Europass to promote interoperability and transparency in education and training.

**How does ELM ensure recognition across borders?**  
By providing a common language and standardised descriptions, ELM facilitates international recognition and verification of qualifications and learning outcomes.
