# European Higher Education Microcredential (EUHEMC)

## Overview
The European Higher Education Microcredential (EUHEMC) is a standardized, digitally verifiable credential designed to certify short, focused learning achievements within the European higher education ecosystem. Built on the European Learning Model (ELM) 3.2 and aligned with the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), EUHEMC enables universities, learners, and employers to share, verify, and leverage educational outcomes in a secure, interoperable, and trusted manner.

EUHEMC microcredentials are issued by accredited institutions, such as Rovira i Virgili University, and are tailored to meet the demands of a dynamic labor market, lifelong learning, and professional upskilling. They provide a flexible, modular approach to education, allowing learners to acquire specific skills and competences that are immediately applicable in professional contexts.

## Business Value

  - A Learning Outcome with at least one Competence and optional ESCO skills for alignment with European skill frameworks.
  - Credits ranging from 1 to 15 ECTS, ensuring measurable educational value.
- **Digital and Verifiable**: Issued as JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials (VCs) using EBSI’s JAdES D-Zero signature profile, ensuring security, authenticity, and tamper-proof verification.
- **Interoperability**: Recognized across EU member states via EBSI’s trusted registries, facilitating cross-border education and employment.
- **Flexibility**: Supports diverse use cases, from professional development to academic progression, with stackable credentials.

## Use Cases
- **Professional Upskilling**:  
  A mid-career professional completes a 5-ECTS EUHEMC in “Advanced Data Analysis” from Rovira i Virgili University, earning a verifiable credential that enhances their resume and qualifies them for a data-driven role.
- **Corporate Training**:  
  A company partners with a university to offer EUHEMC microcredentials in cybersecurity, enabling employees to gain certified skills while continuing work, with credentials verified by HR systems.

  A learner from Spain presents an EUHEMC to a German employer, who verifies its authenticity via EBSI, ensuring trust in the candidate’s qualifications.

## Why EUHEMC Matters
In an era of rapid technological change and evolving job markets, EUHEMC bridges the gap between traditional education and modern workforce needs. It empowers universities to deliver agile, market-relevant education, equips learners with portable and verifiable skills, and enables employers to make informed hiring and training decisions. By leveraging EBSI’s blockchain technology, EUHEMC ensures trust, security, and scalability, positioning Europe as a leader in digital education innovation.
