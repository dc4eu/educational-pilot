# **Upper Secondary Education Transcript of Records(EUUSTOR) - Digital Credential Specification**

## Overview

The **European Upper Secondary Education Transcript of Records (EUUSTOR)** is a digitally verifiable credential that provides a detailed record of academic achievements obtained during upper secondary education. It lists the studentâ€™s completed courses, grades awarded, credit or workload values, and institutional grading scheme. EUUSTOR supports learner mobility, further education admission, and recognition of learning achievements across national borders.

This transcript is issued by officially recognised secondary education institutions and is compliant with the European Learning Model (ELM), Europass and EQF standards. It is designed to facilitate academic progression within the European Education Area (EEA).

## Implementation Considerations

* Institutions must align credit/workload values with national standards and EQF where applicable.
* EUUSTOR credentials should be issued and stored in interoperable digital formats.
* Grading schemes must be transparently included and understood across jurisdictions.
* Integration with Europass and learner wallets is recommended to maximise accessibility and reuse.
