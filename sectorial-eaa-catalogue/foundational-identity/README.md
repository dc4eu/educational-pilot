# Foundational Identity

## Overview

This section covers the foundational identity models that serve as the basis for secure identification across the European educational and professional qualifications ecosystem. These models implement the principles described in the sectorial rulebook while conforming to European regulations for digital identity.

## Components

### Person Identification Data (PID) for Natural Persons

The Person Identification Data model provides a standardised approach for representing and verifying the identity of natural persons:

- Core identity attributes (name, date of birth, nationality, etc.)
- Biometric information (where applicable)
- Official identification numbers
- Residence information
- Contact details

For detailed schema information, see [PID Schema](./pid-schema.md).

### Legal Entity Identification

These models provide standardised digital identification for educational institutions and other relevant organisations:

- Legal entity identifiers
- Digital certificates
- Qualified seals
- Organisational structures
- Accreditation verification

For detailed schema information, see [Legal Entity ID Schema](./legal-entity-schema.md).

### Identity Matching

These models define how identity can be reliably matched across different systems and jurisdictions:

- Cross-system identity correlation
- Attribute matching rules
- Confidence levels
- Minimum data sets for matching
- Privacy-preserving matching protocols

For detailed schema information, see [Identity Matching Schema](./identity-matching-schema.md).

### Cross-Border Identity Verification

These models specify how identity verification works across European borders:

- eIDAS node integration
- Cross-border authentication flows
- Minimum interoperability requirements
- Mutual recognition mechanisms
- Level of assurance mappings

For detailed schema information, see [Cross-Border Verification Schema](./cross-border-verification-schema.md).

### Privacy-Preserving Identity Protocols

These models define how identity information can be shared while protecting privacy:

- Selective disclosure mechanisms
- Zero-knowledge proof protocols
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Minimum disclosure requirements
- User consent mechanisms

For detailed schema information, see [Privacy Protocols Schema](./privacy-protocols-schema.md).

## Implementation in Educational Contexts

In the educational and professional qualifications context, foundational identity serves several critical functions:

1. **Secure Credential Issuance**: Ensuring credentials are issued to the correct individual
2. **Reliable Authentication**: Providing high-assurance identity verification during educational processes
3. **Cross-Border Recognition**: Enabling consistent identification across European educational systems
4. **Privacy Protection**: Implementing data minimisation and purpose limitation for identity data
5. **Institutional Authority**: Verifying the authenticity and authority of educational institutions

## Relationship to European Digital Identity Framework

The foundational identity models align with and extend the European Digital Identity Framework:

- Implementing the Person Identification Data (PID) model as defined in the European Digital Identity Wallet framework
- Supporting the eIDAS 2.0 trust framework for educational credential verification
- Enabling privacy-preserving selective disclosure of educational attributes
- Facilitating cross-border recognition of educational and professional qualifications

## Governance and Trust Models

The foundational identity framework operates within:

- The European trust framework for electronic identification
- National identity and electronic identification schemes
- Sectorial governance for educational credentials
- Institutional trust relationships
- Data protection regulatory requirements

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the foundational identity models:

- Ensure full compliance with GDPR and relevant privacy regulations
- Implement appropriate security measures for identity data protection
- Balance user privacy with verification needs
- Support inclusive accessibility for all users
- Maintain compatibility with broader European digital identity initiatives

## Future Developments

The foundational identity models will evolve in alignment with:

- Updates to the European Digital Identity framework
- Advances in privacy-enhancing technologies
- Emerging standards for digital identity
- Feedback from educational stakeholders
- Experience gained from implementation projects:0
