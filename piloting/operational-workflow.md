# ðŸ§­ Operational Workflow for Tracking Pilots in DC4EU

This document defines the step-by-step process for maintaining accurate and up-to-date dashboards for Piloting Agents (PAs), SPOCs, and Coordinators.

---

## Objective

Ensure that three levels of visibility are always synchronised and consistent:

1. **Piloting Agent (PA)** â€“ Progress and scenario documentation
2. **SPOC** â€“ Consolidated view of all assigned PAs
3. **Project Coordinator** â€“ Global view across all SPOCs and PAs

---

## Step 1 â€“ Piloting Agent actions: document and update

| Task | Actor | Tools / Files |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Describe user journeys and context | PA | `PA-<name>/README.md` |
| Complete the checklist as implementation progresses | PA | `PA-<name>/PA-checklist.md` |
| Ensure folder is correctly named and committed | PA / SPOC | `PA-<institution>` folder |

âœ… **Outcome**: Each PA has a self-contained folder with their scenario and progress.

---

## Step 2 â€“ SPOC actions: supervise and validate

| Task | Actor | Tools / Files |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Review and validate user journeys in README | SPOC | `PA-<name>/README.md` |
| Complete the verification checklist | SPOC | `PA-<name>/SPOC-checklist.md` |
| Track issues, risks, and recommendations | SPOC | Directly in the checklist |
| Ensure alignment between PA documentation and real status | SPOC | Visual/manual or scripted validation |

âœ… **Outcome**: SPOC provides assurance and oversight over PA documentation.

---

## Step 3 â€“ Automation: extract and generate progress indicators

| Task | Actor | Tools / Scripts |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Run checklist parser to extract completion % and dates | SPOC or Coordinator | `repo_progress_parser.py` |
| Generate unified CSV of all PAs | Script | `piloting/OVERVIEW/indicators.csv` |
| Generate SPOC dashboards with live progress | Script | `generate_spoc_dashboards.py` â†’ `SPOC-*/index.md` |

âœ… **Outcome**: Real-time status tables are auto-generated for each SPOC and the whole project.

---

## Step 4 â€“ Coordinator actions: global visibility

| Task | Actor | Tools / Files |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Review CSV file in spreadsheet or dashboard | Coordinator | `OVERVIEW/indicators.csv` |
| Review SPOC summary dashboards | Coordinator | `SPOC-*/index.md` |
| Maintain project-level progress summary | Coordinator | `OVERVIEW/progress-summary.md` (manually or auto-generated) |

âœ… **Outcome**: The coordination team has a full picture of implementation across the network.
