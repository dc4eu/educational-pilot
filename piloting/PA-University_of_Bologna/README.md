# University of Bologna (UNIBO) - Pilot 2 - Combined dPKI (EBSI) & classical PKI (Trust Lists)

## Scenario Description

The University of Bologna (UNIBO) scenario involves digital credential implementation focusing on education onboarding, academic achievement issuance, and verification of educational attestations. UNIBO intends to pilot this scenario initially with 25 final-year undergraduate students, using tools and services from Pilot 2 provided by IZERTIS.

## Key Steps per User Journey

### 1. Onboarding in Education
- Select 25 final-year undergraduate students.
- Conduct initial basic training covering eIDAS2, PID, EAAs, the DC4EU framework, and the significance of the EUDIW.
- Ensure each student obtains and configures the EUDIW wallet provided by IZERTIS.
- Individually verify each student's identity, providing access credentials for PID retrieval.
- Guide students through the PID retrieval process, ensuring wallets are fully operational.
- Students carry out the "EducationalID request" validated through the presentation and verification of PID.
- Successful validation results in issuance of EducationalID, officially confirming the student's affiliation with UNIBO.

### 2. Educational Achievement Issuance
- Students who completed onboarding request academic achievements issuance.
- Students utilise their EducationalID in the EUDIW wallet to securely access an achievement request portal.
- System executes identity matching against institutional academic databases to provide a personalised list of available achievements.
- Students select and confirm achievements for issuance as Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAA).
- After final confirmation, the selected EAAs are issued, accepted by students, and securely stored in their EUDIW wallets.

### 3. Generic EAA Verification
- Public verification service accessible for holders of educational EAAs stored in EUDIW.
- Users present their educational EAA, selecting from sectoral catalogues via the EUDIW wallet.
- The system verifies the presented EAA's integrity and compliance with governance criteria.
- The verification process includes validation of issuer legitimacy, appropriate identification of the education issuer, and confirmation of authorisation from educational governance authorities.
- Upon successful verification, confirmation of EAA validity and authenticity is provided.
