# Educational and Professional Qualifications Framework

## Overview

This repository provides comprehensive documentation and implementation guidance for the European Educational and Professional Qualifications digital credentials framework. It encompasses sectorial rulebooks, data models, implementation toolkits, and compliance information for creating interoperable systems that respect European values of privacy, institutional autonomy, and cross-border mobility.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised into several key sections:

- **[Sectorial Rulebook](./sectorial-rulebook/)**: The core framework that establishes standardised approaches for managing digital educational and professional credentials within the European Union.

- **[Sectorial EAA Catalogue](./sectorial-eaa-catalogue/)**: Contains all data models and schemas agreed at sectorial level for Education and Professional Qualifications, including formal education, quality assurance regimes, and non-foundational ID.

- **[eIDAS Scenarios](./ebsi-scenarios.md)**: Outlines the four trust models for electronic attestation of attributes (EAAs) within the European Digital Ecosystem, explaining how EBSI enhances traditional PKI approaches.

- **[eIDAS roles](./docs/eIDAS-roles.md)**: Outlines the key roles within the European digital identity framework under eIDAS, detailing their definitions, functions, types of attestations issued, regulatory references, and compliance requirements. 

- **[Authorisation Model](./authorisation-model.md)**: Defines a structured framework for managing authorisations, accreditation, and recognition within educational, professional, and quality assurance domains.

- **[Toolkits](./toolkits/)**: Implementation resources including technical architecture, component descriptions, workflows (RFCs), and specific use cases to help develop user journeys.

- **[[User journeys](./user-journeys/)**: Provided user journeys to demonstrate cross-border interaction, ready-to go infrastructure, and foundation to extend/provide more user journeys and/or EAAs

- **[Compliance](./compliance/)**: Information about EBSI and EUDI Wallet compliance tests to ensure interoperability with other issuer, verifier, and wallet solutions.

## Key Features

This framework brings together European educational priorities:

- Respects member state sovereignty in education

- Links to quality frameworks
- Creates trusted credentials
- Enables automatic recognition
- Supports lifelong learning
- Records formal and informal learning
- Works across European borders

## Getting Started

For new users, we recommend starting with:

1. Review the [Sectorial Rulebook](./sectorial-rulebook/) to understand the framework principles
2. Learn about the [eIDAS Scenarios](./ebsi-scenarios.md) to understand the trust models
3. Explore the [Authorisation Model](./authorisation-model.md) to understand how trust chains work
4. Identify your [role(s)](./docs/eIDAS-roles.md) within the ecosystem
5. Explore the [Toolkits](./toolkits/) section for implementation guidance
6. Understand the [User journeys](./user-journeys/) provided
7. Check the [Compliance](./compliance/) requirements for interoperability information
