# Educational and Professional Qualifications Framework

## Overview

This repository provides comprehensive documentation and implementation guidance for the European Educational and Professional Qualifications digital credentials framework. It encompasses sectorial rulebooks, data models, implementation toolkits, and compliance information for creating interoperable systems that respect European values of privacy, institutional autonomy, and cross-border mobility.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised into several key sections:

- **[Sectorial Rulebook](./sectorial-rulebook/)**: The core framework that establishes standardised approaches for managing digital educational and professional credentials within the European Union.

- **[Sectorial EAA Rulebook](./sectorial-eaa-rulebook/)**: Contains all data models and schemas agreed at sectorial level for Education and Professional Qualifications, including formal education, quality assurance regimes, and non-foundational ID.

- **[Toolkits](./toolkits/)**: Implementation resources including technical architecture, component descriptions, workflows (RFCs), and specific use cases to help develop user journeys.

- **[Compliance](./compliance/)**: Information about EBSI and EUDI Wallet compliance tests to ensure interoperability with other issuer, verifier, and wallet solutions.
