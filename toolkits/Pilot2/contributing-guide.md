## Introduction: What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform that we use to organise our project. Although GitHub was originally created for software developers, we are using it as a centralised space for documentation, communication and issue tracking.

As a Piloting Agent, you don't need technical knowledge to use the basic functions that will allow you to communicate with the project team.

## Before you begin: What you'll need

To participate as a Piloting Agent, you will need:

- A computer with internet access
- An email address
- Approximately 15 minutes to set up your account for the first time

## Creating your account

1. **Visit GitHub**: Open your web browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. **Register**: Click on "Sign up" and follow the instructions
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a password
   - Choose a username (it can be your real name or a pseudonym)
3. **Verify your account**: Check your email and click on the verification link
4. **Complete your profile**: Add a profile picture and a brief description (optional but recommended)

## Getting familiar with the project

Once you have created your account, the project administrator will send you an invitation to join the project repository.

1. **Accept the invitation**: Check your email and click on the invitation link
2. **Explore the repository**: When you access the project, you will see several sections:
   - **Code**: Where project files are stored
   - **Issues**: Where problems are reported and enquiries are made
   - **Pull requests**: Proposed changes (you won't need to use this section)
   - **Discussions**: Forums for general conversations
   - **Wiki**: Detailed project documentation

Most of your activity will be centred on the "Issues" section.

## How to make enquiries

To ask a question or make an enquiry:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab of the repository
2. Click on the green "New issue" button
3. In the title, write a brief description of your enquiry
   - **Good example**: "What is the deadline for completing the testing phase?"
   - **Poor example**: "I have a question"
4. In the content area, explain your enquiry in detail
5. Add the "question" or "enquiry" label (by selecting from the right column under "Labels")
6. Click on "Submit new issue"

## How to report issues

If you find something that isn't working as it should:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. Click on "New issue"
3. Use a descriptive title that summarises the problem
4. In the content, include:
   - **What happened?** Describe the problem you encountered
   - **What did you expect to happen?** Explain how it should work
   - **When and where did it occur?** Mention the date and in which part of the project
   - **Screenshots** (if possible): You can add them by dragging the image to the text area
5. Add the "bug" or "problem" label
6. Click on "Submit new issue"

## How to suggest improvements

If you have ideas to improve the project:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. Click on "New issue"
3. Use a title that describes your suggestion
4. In the content, explain:
   - **What is your idea?** Describe the improvement you're proposing
   - **Why would it be useful?** Explain the benefits of implementing it
   - **Do you have any suggestions on how to implement it?** (optional)
5. Add the "enhancement" or "improvement" label
6. Click on "Submit new issue"

## Tracking your communications

To see the status of your enquiries, issues or suggestions:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. In the search box, type `author:your-username` to see all your communications
3. Click on any issue to see:
   - Comments added by the team
   - Current status (open or closed)
   - Assigned labels

The possible statuses are:
- **Open**: The issue is pending resolution
- **Closed**: The issue has been resolved or the enquiry has been answered

## Notifications and updates

To stay informed about updates:

1. By default, you will receive email notifications when:
   - Someone comments on your issues
   - Someone mentions you using @your-username
2. To adjust your notification preferences:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select "Settings"
   - Go to "Notifications"
   - Customise your preferences

You can also enable browser notifications by selecting this option in the settings.

## Frequently asked questions

**Do I need to install anything on my computer?**  
No, GitHub works completely in your web browser.

**Will my enquiries be visible to all project members?**  
Yes, all project participants will be able to see and respond to your issues.

**What do I do if I make a mistake in my enquiry or report?**  
You can edit your issue by clicking on the three dots (...) in the top right corner of the message and selecting "Edit".

**Can I add files or images to my reports?**  
Yes, you can drag and drop images directly into the text area. You can also attach files by clicking on the text area and selecting them from your computer.

**What does it mean when an issue is "closed"?**  
A closed issue means it has been resolved or the enquiry has been satisfactorily answered. If you need to reopen the conversation, you can comment on the closed issue.
