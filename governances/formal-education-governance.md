# Formal Education Governance

This section provides a business-oriented explanation of how formal education is governed across the European Union, focusing on trust delegation, institutional recognition, and digital validation through the DC4EU framework.

## What is formal education governance?

Formal education governance defines **which institutions** are legally authorised to deliver recognised educational programmes and **issue credentials** such as diplomas, certificates, and degrees.  
It ensures that education is delivered under **public mandate**, follows national legislation, and is **recognised across Europe** through shared frameworks like the **EQF** and **Bologna Process**.

---

## Is there a central European authority?

No. The **governance of education is a national competence**.  
Each Member State defines:
- What types of education are recognised (e.g. vocational, academic)
- Which institutions are allowed to operate and issue credentials
- Which authority is responsible for each education level (e.g. ministries)

At the European level, there are only **coordination tools**, such as:
- The **European Qualifications Framework (EQF)**
- The **European Education Area (EEA)**
- EU-wide recognition principles (e.g. Lisbon Recognition Convention)

## How is governance organised in the Member States?

Member States usually adopt a **multi-level delegation model**:

1. **Ministries / Central Public Authorities**  
   - Recognise and accredit schools, VET providers, universities  
   - Define which qualifications correspond to EQF levels  
   - Grant licences to operate and issue degrees  
   - May divide responsibilities by education level (e.g. primary, higher)

2. **Recognised Educational Institutions**  
   - Schools, colleges, universities, and training centres  
   - Must hold a **valid licence or mandate** to operate and issue official qualifications  
   - Must comply with national and European education frameworks

3. **Professional or Sectoral Bodies** *(in some cases)*  
   - May be involved in curricula approval, especially in vocational education  

All authorisations (licences, EQF alignment, ID rights) can be captured in the form of **Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs)** to enable verifiable digital trust.

## What does this governance model enable?

- Ensures **legal validity** of diplomas and academic records  
- Supports **mobility** and automatic recognition across Member States  
- Enables **trusted digital credential issuance** by legitimate institutions  
- Provides **traceability and transparency** of institutional mandates  
- Aligns with EU strategies (e.g. EEA, Micro-Credentials, Europass)

## Example in practice

Let’s say the **Rovira i Virgili University (URV)** in Spain issues a Master’s degree:

1. URV must be authorised by the **Ministry of Science, Research and Universities**  
2. The Ministry grants an EAA for:
   - `HigherEducationInstitution`  
   - `LicenceToActAtNationalLevel`  
   - `EQFlevel7`  
   - `EducationalID`  
3. This EAA confirms that URV:
   - Is a legitimate higher education institution  
   - Can issue degrees legally recognised at EQF Level 7  
   - Can be digitally verified by verifiers across Europe
