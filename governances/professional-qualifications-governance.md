# Professional Qualifications Governance

This section provides a business-oriented explanation of how professional qualifications are governed across the European Union, with a focus on legal recognition, authorising bodies, and digital trust within the DC4EU framework.

## What are professional qualifications?

Professional qualifications are the legal or regulatory requirements a person must meet in order to practise a specific profession. These include:

- Degrees and formal education  
- Professional exams or evaluations  
- Ongoing registration with a professional body  
- Licences or IDs confirming suitability to practise  

Professions such as medicine, law, engineering, teaching, or architecture often fall under this governance.

## Is there a central European authority?

No. The European Union does **not centrally regulate professions**.  

Instead:
- Each **Member State defines** which professions are regulated.  
- The **EU provides a legal framework** to support **mutual recognition**, such as the **Professional Qualifications Directive** and tools like the **Internal Market Information System (IMI)**.  

So, regulation and licensing remain **national**, but must align with **EU-level transparency and mobility principles**.

## How is governance organised in Member States?

Professional qualifications governance usually follows this model:

1. **Ministry or Public Authority**  
   - Defines and recognises regulated professions.  
   - Authorises **National Professional Bodies** to oversee them.  
   - Example: **Ministry of Health** in Spain.

2. **National Professional Body (NPB)**  
   - Legally authorised to:
     - Issue professional licences or certificates  
     - Maintain professional registers  
     - Oversee continuing professional development (CPD)  
     - Represent the profession at national and European levels  
   - Example: **CGCOM** for doctors in Spain.

3. **Professionals / Institutions**  
   - Individuals receive credentials (e.g. **ProfessionalID**)  
   - Training institutions may be accredited for CPD delivery  

Each level of authorisation is **documented and verifiable**, using **Electronic Attestations of Attributes (EAAs)**.

---

## What are the benefits of this governance model?

- Provides **clarity** on who is legally allowed to practise a regulated profession  
- Enables **automatic or semi-automatic recognition** across Member States  
- Makes it possible to **digitally verify**:
  - The authority of the issuer  
  - The recognition of the profession  
  - Whether a professional is in good standing  
- Helps safeguard **public trust, safety, and mobility**

## Example in practice

Let’s say **Ana is a licensed doctor in Spain**, and she wants to practise in France:

1. Ana is licensed by **CGCOM**, authorised by the **Ministry of Health**.  
2. CGCOM issues her an **Electronic Certificate of Professional Suitability (eCIP)**.  
3. This credential is:
   - Digitally signed  
   - Linked to a valid EAA proving CGCOM's authorisation  
4. A French hospital can instantly verify the credential, and Ana’s licence — even before she travels.
