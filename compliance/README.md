# Compliance Information

## Overview

This section provides information about the compliance testing and standards adherence for implementations based on this framework. Compliance with these standards ensures interoperability with other issuer, verifier, and wallet solutions across the European ecosystem.

## EBSI Wallet Compliance

The framework is designed to be compliant with EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure) wallet requirements. This ensures that implementations can interoperate with the broader European digital identity ecosystem.

### Current Compliance Status

| Tool | Version | Holder | Issuer | Verifier | Trust Model |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| uself-agent | v0.0.3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

For detailed information about EBSI compliance testing and requirements, see [EBSI Compliance](./ebsi-compliance.md).

## EUDI Wallet Compliance

The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet framework establishes standards for digital identity wallets across the EU. Compliance with these standards ensures that implementations can work with the official European digital identity ecosystem.

For detailed information about EUDI wallet compliance testing and requirements, see [EUDI Compliance](./eudi-compliance.md).

## Compliance Testing

Implementers are encouraged to regularly test their systems against these compliance standards. Testing resources include:

- EBSI conformance testing service
- EUDI reference implementation tests
- Interoperability testing with other compliant systems

## Versioning and Updates

Compliance requirements may evolve as European standards develop. This section will be updated to reflect the latest compliance requirements and testing procedures.

## Certification

Information about official certification processes for compliant implementations will be added as these processes become available through European governance bodies.
